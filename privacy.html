            <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Asifah Analytics is a free, open-source intelligence (OSINT) dashboard that aggregates publicly available information. We do not collect personal information, we do not require user accounts, and we do not sell data. We use Google Analytics to understand site traffic and improve the user experience.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Asifah Analytics ("we," "our," or "us").

        <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>When you visit our Site, certain information is automatically collected through standard web technologies:</p>
        
        <ul>

                Google Analytics uses cookies to collect this information. For more details, see Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Our Site is hosted and protected by Cloudflare, which may collect:

                Cloudflare acts as a security and performance layer. See Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We store your language preference (English, Hebrew, Arabic, or Farsi) locally in your browser using localStorage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>Our Site uses cookies primarily for Google Analytics. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us understand site usage.</p>

        <h3>Types of Cookies We Use:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Google Analytics uses cookies to track anonymous usage patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> Your language selection is stored in localStorage (not transmitted to servers)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Control Cookies:</h3>
        <p>You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt out of Google Analytics:</strong> Install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a></li>

            <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals, as there is no industry standard for compliance</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Disabling cookies may affect some Site functionality, such as language preferences not being saved between visits.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information, there is no user data to retain or delete. Analytics data is retained according to Google Analytics' default settings (26 months) and is anonymous.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 General Rights</h3>
        <p>Because we do not collect personal information, most data rights (access, deletion, correction) do not apply. However, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opt out of analytics tracking (see Section 5 above)</li>
            <li>Disable cookies in your browser</li>
            <li>Clear your local storage (language preference) manually</li>
            <li>Contact us with questions about our privacy practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.2 GDPR (European Users)</h3>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have specific rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not collect personal data, GDPR obligations are minimal. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Our use of Google Analytics is based on legitimate interest in understanding site usage</li>
            <li><strong>Data Controller:</strong> Google Analytics acts as a data processor; Google is the data controller for analytics data</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may object to analytics tracking by opting out (see Section 5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.3 CCPA (California Users)</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights. However, because we do not sell personal information and do not collect identifiable data, most CCPA obligations do not apply. For transparency:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Categories of Information:</strong> We collect only anonymous analytics data (see Section 2.2)</li>
            <li><strong>Sale of Information:</strong> We do not sell personal information</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of analytics tracking (see Section 5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take data security seriously, even though we collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our Site is encrypted using SSL/TLS</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare Protection:</strong> Our Site benefits from Cloudflare's security features, including DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF)</li>
            <li><strong>No Stored User Data:</strong> Since we don't collect personal information, there is no user database to secure or breach</li>
            <li><strong>Public Data Only:</strong> All threat intelligence data we process is from publicly available sources</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While we implement reasonable security measures, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Site is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Our Site is accessible globally. Data processed by Google Analytics and Cloudflare may be transferred to and stored on servers in various countries, including the United States. By using our Site, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection laws.</p>

        <h2>11. Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our Site contains links to external websites, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>News sources referenced in our threat analysis</li>

        <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

        <h2>12. Future Features</h2>
        <p>As Asifah Analytics evolves, we may introduce new features. If we implement features that collect personal information, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and provide notice on the Site. Planned future features may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alert System:</strong> Email or SMS notifications for significant threat changes (would require email/phone collection with explicit consent)</li>
            <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> Optional registration for personalized dashboards (would require account data)</li>
            <li><strong>API Access:</strong> Developer API for programmatic access (would require API key management)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Any such features will be opt-in, and you will have full control over what information you choose to provide.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will:</p>
